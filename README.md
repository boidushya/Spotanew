<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 

Discover new songs by listening to a 30 second snippet of a random song from Spotify. Made for audiophiles and music-lovers who find it hard to explore all the amazing music out there. There are dozens of different genres with thousands of songs and it is hard to listen to all of them. Spotanew provides a way to simplify this.

- Each time you visit [Spotanew](https://spotanew.vercel.app/), you are presented with a completely random song selected from Spotify's some of the most popular playlists spanning a dozen different genres. 

- Open it in Spotify and add it to your playlists if it matches your vibe with a click of a button.

- Don't feel it? No worries! Just click on the random song button and get another random song to listen to!
